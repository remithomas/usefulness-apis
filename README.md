# Usefulness APIs

## What and Why ?

An _usefulness_ API is an API with some basic (important) features, like `user connexion`, `setted database` and `Docker` ready. Every projects *have to* be developped in _TDD_.

It's like a boilerplate to set up a project quickly.

## Features

- user connexion/registration
- using a database with migration possibilities
- Docker ready
- a dev environment already configured (editor, lint, travis, code coverage)

## Contributions

Never hesitate to contribute to the follow repositories. Submit _issues_, _comments_ and _PRs_ !
You can also create your own repositories.

## How to avoid Useful _mess_ ?

- Just _Pull Request_ never _ninja merge_ or whatever solutions you did to quick fix any _mess_ or dev
- If you are using [Travis](https://travis-ci.org) always wait the green bullet, even if its' trivial, otherwise why use _travis_ ??
